###Scenarios:

1. Mentee's count(first preference) strictly 1.
2. If more than one mentee chose a mentor as 1st choice, chose the mentor's 1st preference.
3. If more than one mentee chose a mentor as 1st choice, but the mentor has not chosen either of the mentee as a first- try 2nd, or Human Intervention.
4. Repeat 1 to 3 for second preference.
5. Rest mark as Human Intervention.
